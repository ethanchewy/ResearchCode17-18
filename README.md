# Scripts I wrote for my research project
#TODO after research is done:
- make scripts easier to use for anyone and make them into pip packages.

Note: All of my data analysis scripts using ntlk, Pandas, etc. will be published after this research paper is published (Late Jan, 2018) as per conference rules.
